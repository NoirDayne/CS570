I wrote the p3helper.c code myself.
I believe everything works perfectly under all conditions.
I achieved successful coordination by trial and error and seeing which 
ways to modify the critical sections in order to manipulate
it into achieving the output required. To check if it had reached
its width I had a for loop that checked for any remainders. If it hadn't
reached the quota or the width then it would print the regular widget.

There is one mysterious glitch I can't seem to figure out.
The program will not exit until alarm clock is triggered,
that is the one fault.
